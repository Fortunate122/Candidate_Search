# Candidate Search

## Description
This is a full-stack candidate search application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. The application uses the GitHub API to retrieve public developer profiles and allows an employer to review, accept, and manage potential candidates. Candidates can be saved locally and reviewed in a sortable, filterable table. The app is deployed on Render.

## Motivation
My motivation behind this application was to create a clean, scalable candidate management tool that leverages GitHub user data and demonstrates frontend + API integration with modern tools like Vite and TypeScript.

## Usage
This project will be used to showcase my understanding of RESTful APIs, React hooks, localStorage, and user interaction patterns. It also demonstrates good UI/UX with persistent state management.

## License
This project is licensed under the None license.

## Learning
I learned how to build a dynamic, single-page app with type-safe components, implement localStorage for persistence, and integrate GitHub API securely with environment variables.

## Standout
What makes my project stand out is the ability to:
- Randomly pull GitHub users
- Review one at a time
- Save promising candidates
- Filter and sort the saved list
- Persist data in localStorage
